# FSJS Week 5 - Mongo!!!!

**Outline**

2. Install Mongo (Go ahead and start on this)
1. Set up for week5
3. Create a model and seed it with data
4. Connect Mongo to our application

## 1. Install Mongo
**Windows**:  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

**Linux**
 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/

**OSX**
 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/


## 2. Setup Project
1. (optional) Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeLouisville/FSJS-class-project.git
cd FSJS-class-project
```

**OR** if you need to ditch your current changes and pull a fresh copy down, try this:
```
git stash
git pull
```

2. Get rid of `week5` (we're going to rebuild it)
```
rm -rf week5
```

3. Copy `week4` to `week5`
```
cp -R week4 week5
cd week5
```

4. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

5. Install mongoose
```
npm install mongoose --save
```

## HOLD THE PHONE...
**What is Mongo? Sounds like a cartoon character's name...**

Mongo is a database.  It is a place to store structured data so that your application can quickly and easily find it later.  Mongo is known as a no-SQL database. In the case of Mongo, that means that it stores data in units called `documents` - which look just like javascript objects (key-value pairs, nested objects, arrays, etc.).

## WAIT A MINUTE....
**What is this `mongoose` of which you speak?**

Mongoose is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool.  It is used in your application to make the process of querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a Mongo database.  In addition, it turns the plain ol' javascript objects you get back from Mongo in to more feature-rich objects for your application to use.

## Create a model using mongoose

**In a nutshell, we will:**
1. Tell mongoose how to talk to the mongo server
2. Make sure mongoose connects to mongo when your application starts.
3. Create a "model" in mongoose.  This is where you define what your data looks like.
4. Use Mongo in our route handlers instead of the array we've been using.
5. Add some test data.


### Configure our app to work with mongo
1. Edit our config file (at `src/config/index.js`) so that the returned configuration object includes mongo configuration:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      appName: 'Our Glorious Node Project',
      port: 3030,
      db: {
        host: 'localhost',
        dbName: 'fsjs',
      }
    };
    ```

2. Connect to mongo through the mongoose library.  In `src/server.js`, somewhere near the top of the file, import mongoose with
    ```javascript
    // Load mongoose package
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    ```
    Then, somewhere AFTER the line where you load your configuration, connect with the following
    ```javascript
    // Connect to MongoDB and create/use database as configured
    mongoose.connection.openUri(`mongodb://${config.db.host}/${config.db.dbName}`);
    ```


### Build the model

1. In the `src/models` directory, create an empty file called `file.model.js`
2. At the top of that file, pull in mongoose
    ```javascript
    // Load mongoose package
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    ```

3. Create a schema
    ```javascript
    const FileSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      title: String,
      description: String,
      created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
    });
    ```
    Notice that the `title` and `description` fields are also present in our faked data (`/src/routes/index.js`).  We've also added a new field called `created_at`, which will be a Date and will default to the current time.

4. Turn that schema in to a mongoose model, register it, and export it
    ```javascript
    const File = mongoose.model('File', FileSchema);
    module.exports = File;
    ```
    A lot is going on here.  We are storing the `File` schema inside the mongoose object (which will make it available anywhere in your application).  We're also giving a name ("File") so we can distinguish it from any other model we may want to register.  We're also exporting the model from this module.

5. Make sure that the `file.model.js` script is run by `require`-ing it somewhere...like in `src/server.js`, below the line where we connect mongoose to mongo:
    ```javascript
    // Import all models
    require('./models/file.model.js');
    ```

## Connect to our app
1. In `src/routes/index.js`, pull in mongoose at the top of the file.
    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    ```

2. Edit the `GET /file` route.  Replace our development code with
    ```javascript
    mongoose.model('File').find({}, function(err, files) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return res.status(500).json(err);
      }

      res.json(files);
    });
    ```
    **Model.find:** http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.find

3. Restart server and test - **Where did our data go?**

### What about some test data?
Strategy: On startup, check if there are any files in the database, if not, then add files from a seed file.

1. Create a file in `/src/models` called `file.seed.json`
    ```json
    [
      {"title":"Satellite of Love Plans.svg", "description": "Includes fix for exhaust port vulnerability" },
      {"title":"Rules of Cribbage.doc", "description": "9th edition" },
      {"title":"avengers_fanfic.txt", "description": "PRIVATE DO NOT READ" }
    ]
    ```

2. In `file.model.js`, after you create and export the model, get the current count of documents in the collection
    ```javascript
    File.count({}, function(err, count) {
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }
      // ...
    });
    ```
    **Model.count:** http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.count

3. Add the seed data
    ```javascript
    if (count > 0) return ;

    const files = require('./file.seed.json');
    File.create(files, function(err, newFiles) {
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }
      console.log("DB seeded")
    });
    ```
